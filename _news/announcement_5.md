I am excited to start my new position as a Computational Biologist at the [Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/sf/) in San Francisco, USA. I will be working in the [Computational Biology Platform](https://www.czbiohub.org/comp-biology/), lead by [Yasin Şenbabaoğlu](https://www.czbiohub.org/sf/people/staff/yasin-senbabaoglu-phd/).
