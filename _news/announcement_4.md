I successfully defended my [PhD Thesis](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/34849/) at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. I want to thank my Defense committe Henrik Kaessmann, Arnaud Krebs, Judith Zaugg and Duncan Odom. And of course I want to thank my supervisor Oliver Stegle, who made this possible.
