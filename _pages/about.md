I am a PhD student at the <a href=https://www.embl.org/>EMBL</a> Heidelberg in Germany. My research focusses on building models for high-dimensional biological datasets. I studied Systems Biology at ETH Zurich where I worked on software for detecting protein complexes from mass-spectrometry data in the lab of Prof. Ruedi Aebersold. During my PhD I developed modeling frameworks to study developmental processes using multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies under the supervision of Prof. Oliver Stegle.
