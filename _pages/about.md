I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) in Heidelberg, Germany. My research focusses on building models for high-dimensional biological datasets.
I studied Systems Biology at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) where I worked on software for detecting protein complexes from mass-spectrometry data in the lab of Prof. [Ruedi Aebersold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruedi_Aebersold). During my PhD I developed modeling frameworks to study developmental processes using multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies under the supervision of Prof. [Oliver Stegle](https://www.embl.org/groups/stegle/). Currently, I am continuing this work in my Postdoctoral Fellowship.
